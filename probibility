Probability
The last column of the output shows the probability of drawing a t-statistic (or a z-statistic) as extreme as the one actually observed, under the assumption that the errors are normally distributed, or that the estimated coefficients are asymptotically normally distributed.
This probability is also known as the p-value or the marginal significance level. Given a p-value, you can tell at a glance if you reject or accept the hypothesis that the true coefficient is zero against a two-sided alternative that it differs from zero. For example, if you are performing the test at the 5% significance level, a p-value lower than 0.05 is taken as evidence to reject the null hypothesis of a zero coefficient. If you want to conduct a one-sided test, the appropriate probability is one-half that reported by EViews. 
For the above example output, the hypothesis that the coefficient on TB3 is zero is rejected at the 5% significance level but not at the 1% level. However, if theory suggests that the coefficient on TB3 cannot be positive, then a one-sided test will reject the zero null hypothesis at the 1% level.
The p-values for t-statistics are computed from a t-distribution with  degrees of freedom. The p-value for z-statistics are computed using the standard normal distribution.
